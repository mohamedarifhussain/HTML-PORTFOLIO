  <h2>The top 3 movies</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>The Avengers (2012)</h3>
  <p>The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the
    success
    of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would
    bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time portrayed by Edward Norton), and Thor
    (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as
    Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012
    release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production
    began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City
    in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots</p>

    heartbreak[5].</p>
  <h3>Black Panther (2018)</h3>
  <p>Black Panther premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in
    the
    United States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, writing,
    acting , costume design, production values, and soundtrack, but some criticized the visual effects. Many
    critics considered the film to be one of the best in the MCU and it was noted for its cultural significance.
    The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Black Panther one of the top-ten films of
    2018. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, becoming the
    highest-grossing film directed by a Black filmmaker, the ninth-highest-grossing film at the time of its
    release, the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada that year, and the second-highest-grossing
